# Stock-Prediction

We have implemented a Geometric Brownian Motion model in Python for a stochastic differential equation commonly used in quantitative finance.  Although this model has a solution, many do not. For these models, we have to use numerical methods to find approximations, such as Euler-Maruyama, Milstein. 
 
 We have also used the LSTM model to predict the stock which outperformed the other numerical methods.
 
 
### To sum things up, here's a couple of the key takeaways:

1)  A stochastic model can yield any number of different hypothetical paths (predicting stock movements is very difficult).

2)  Numerical models can be used to approximate solutions, but there will always be a tradeoff between computational accuracy and efficiency.
